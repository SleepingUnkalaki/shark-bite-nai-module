Go ahead and call her,\" he said. \"We have a number for her at the house in Denton. She's waiting on us there right now. And she knows exactly where we are. So do all of them. They'll be here any minute. This is going to get very interesting, isn't it?\" He grinned. \"So who wants to go first? Me or you? Or maybe both of us together?\"\nThe two men stared at each other. Then they turned their heads toward the helicopter landing pad. The chopper had just come into view over the trees. It was an old Sikorsky S-61C with a bullet hole through its nose. A second later, the aircraft settled onto the pad, causing the helipad lights to flash off as if they were trying to blind everyone inside the building.\nA moment later, three figures appeared from behind the helicopter: a man in his midforties wearing khaki pants and a blue blazer; a woman of forty dressed similarly but in jeans instead of slacks; and another young woman whose dark hair fell below her shoulders. All wore black T-shirts that read MURDERER IN THE MAIN FLOOR.\nThey moved quickly across the concrete floor and up the stairs, leaving no footprints. When they reached the top step, the older couple stood aside while the younger woman stepped forward and opened the door. Inside the lobby, the air smelled like burnt coffee and wet dog.\nMitch looked down at his watch. \"It's almost four o'clock. Why didn't anyone tell us this would happen so much earlier?\"\n\"What time did you say the flight left?\" asked Ava.\nHe checked his watch again. \"Four twenty-seven P. M.\"\n\"And how long does it take to fly from New York City to Dallas?\"\n\"About twelve hours.\"\nShe smiled. \"Well, then, my husband and I can make our plane reservation after all.\"\nAt 4:00 p.m., the phone rang in Ava's office. She answered it immediately. \"Hello?\"\n\"Is this Mrs. Cameron?\" came a voice she recognized instantly.\n\"Yes,\" replied Ava.\n\"This is Dr. Kaelin. Your husband has been brought back to life by the surgeons. He should be conscious shortly. Do you wish to speak with him?\"\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed Ava. \"How is he doing? Is he okay?\"\nKaelin hesitated before answering. \"I'm afraid not. He suffered some internal injuries when hewas shot, but the doctors managed to repair most of them. However, he will need extensive plastic surgery on his face, and I believe he may also require bone grafts.",

He looked at his reflection in the window. The sub was moving slowly through the water, its hull vibrating with each pulse from the engines.It was dark outside but there was enough moonlight that he could see her face clearly. She smiled up at him. \"It's funny how we're both so different.\"He glanced down again. There was no doubt about it; he was still very much attracted to her. But now what?They'd spent nearly three days together. What did he really feel for her? He wasn't sure anymore.And yet...he felt like he couldn't stop thinking about her.It was strange, because before he hadn't cared whether or not he would be able to get over her. Now all he wanted was to go back to being friends.But then, when he thought about it, he realized that he didn't want that either. It just seemed easier than dealing with whatever feelings he might actually have for her.\"What do you mean?\" he asked finally.\n\"Well, you're always trying to keep your distance from people. You've never let yourself fall in love.\"\"That doesn't make any sense.\"\n\"Maybe it does. Maybe you just can't admit it to yourself.\"\n\"Why are you talking like this is something new?\"\"Because it kind of feels like it is.\"\nHe saw her smile. \"I guess it must seem weird to you, me falling in love with someone who isn't even human.\"\"No, I...\"He stopped himself. He knew why he liked her. Why else had he invited her into his life?Because he needed company after losing his wife. And he also knew why he didn't want anything more from her.There was no future. They weren't meant for one another.\n\"Look,if you're worried about getting hurt, maybe we shouldn't talk anymore,\" she said.\n\"You know what, it's okay,\" he told her.\"We don't need to say goodbye right now.\"\nShe nodded. \"Good.",
