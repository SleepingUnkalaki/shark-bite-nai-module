They had no idea how long it would take them to find a way out of here and if they did, what kind of reception awaited them on the other side. The only thing she knew for certain was that she didn't want to be alone in this cave when those things came looking for their next meal.\nThey set off again through the tunnel, taking care not to slip or fall. A few minutes later, the passage opened up into another cavernous space with more stalactites hanging from above. There were still several miles left to walk before reaching the surface, but at least now they weren't completely lost.\nDriscoll found herself wishing she'd brought along some food and water so they wouldn't need to stop every ten seconds to rest. She wasn't sure how much longer she could keep going like this. Her muscles felt stiffer than ever as they trudged onward. Sweat dripped down her face, stinging her eyes and making her hands sticky.\nSuddenly, something moved ahead of them, just beyond where the light reached. It took a moment for her brain to process what she saw: a dark shape standing upright against one wall. Another creature? Or...\nA man! He stood taller than any human should have been able to reach, his legs spread wide apart, arms akimbo. His head appeared to be shaved bald except for two tufts of hair poking out near his ears. As they drew closer, Driscoll realized he wore nothing but a loincloth made of animal skins. And he was staring directly at her.\nHe looked as though he might charge forward at any second, so Driscoll raised both hands palms-outward, signaling him to stay put. The stranger seemed confused by this gesture, but then shrugged and turned away.\nFor an instant, Driscoll thought maybe they had finally come across someone who could help them escape. But then she noticed the scars covering his body. Not all of them were fresh; others looked old enough to have healed over years ago.\nAnd yet he walked around freely, unafraid of whatever dangers lay ahead. That couldn't possibly be true. Could it?\nAs they continued walking, the tunnel grew darker and narrower until it ended abruptly in front of them. Beyond, there was only blackness.\n\"I'm afraid I don't know which way is back home,\" Driscoll told him. \"But you must lead us out.\"\nThe man shook his head. \"No can do. This place ain't safe for humans.\"\n\"You're welcometo return with me,\" she offered. \"We'll send word back to your people once we've escaped.\"\nThe stranger laughed—a harsh sound, full of bitterness.",

          "request": "The creatures could smell blood.\"He's dead,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"I'm sorry.\"\nShe felt his body slide out of the water and onto the beach.She couldn't look at him as he lay there on the sand. He was so pale. So still. The man who had been alive a moment ago seemed to have died all over again.She closed her eyes, but when she opened them again, he wasn't lying in front of her anymore. He'd disappeared.\n\"Lily?\" His voice came from behind her.She turned around, expecting to see him standing there with that same sad smile. But instead it was someone else wearing the same uniform: Lieutenant Randal O'Brien.His hair looked wet, and he smelled like seawater and something sweet—a flower or maybe candy.It made Lily feel better for some reason.She smiled back at him.\n\"You're not supposed to be here yet,\" she told him. \"They'll kill you if they find out.\"\nRandy nodded.\"Yeah, well... I don't care about that right now. This is amazing!\"\nLily didn't know what to say to that.She just stood there looking down at where Randy's hands were pressed against the side of the boat. It was almost funny how much bigger he was than before. How big everything seemed.She wished he would go away. That this whole thing would end soon.\nBut then he did another strange thing.Instead of going back into the ocean, he climbed up the ladder onto the deck. She heard him talking to one of the men inside the cabin. And then he walked toward her.And suddenly she realized why he had changed. Why everything had gotten bigger. Because Randy had become a giant. A monster.\nA shark-man.As he approached, she saw that his skin had taken on an iridescent blue glow. It reminded her of the scales of a fish, only larger.Longer. Larger teeth. More powerful jaws.\nWhen he reached her, he wrapped both arms around her waist.Then he lifted her off her feet.\nHer heart pounded in terror.Her breath caught in her throat. She struggled to free herself from his grip, but it was no use. He was too strong. Too heavy.Too huge.",
          "response": "She tried to kick him as hard as she could, but even though she kicked high, her foot barely connected with his shin.\nHe laughed at her.The sound boomed through the air,",
