=== Placeholders ==================================
=== Prompt ========================================
The creatures could smell blood.

=== Iteration 0     ==============================

"You're not going to die," she said, and he believed her as the sea rose up around them. He felt himself lifted out of his body into a place where there was no pain or fear, only peace and serenity. The water closed over him again, but this time it took him with it. And when the waters had receded and all that remained were the two bodies floating in the shallows, they still held hands.
* * *
He awoke on the beach, looking at the sun rising above the trees. A gentle breeze blew through the leaves, rustling their branches. His head hurt like hell; he opened one eye to see if anything looked familiar, then shut it quickly. Everything did look familiar—the sand underfoot, the feel of the cool wind against his face, even the taste of salt in his mouth. But something wasn't right. Something was missing...
Then he remembered. They'd died together, swimming for shore after being swept away by an unexpected storm surge.
They hadn't drowned, though. At least, not completely. She must have dragged him ashore somehow, and now they lay sprawled across each other's arms, exhausted from their struggle to survive. It seemed impossible that they'd made it here alive. How long had they been unconscious? Hours? Days? Weeks? Time didn't mean much anymore. All that mattered was waking up here, safe on dry land.
His hand found hers first, and he squeezed gently before opening both eyes fully. Her skin felt warm beneath his palm, which meant she might be breathing. Then he noticed the blood staining her shirt, so he rolled onto his back and saw what else had survived: her pack, lying next to his own. The straps had broken free during the swim, leaving everything inside scattered about the sand. Most important, however, was the small leather case sitting open beside her hip.
She'd left it behind.
Cautiously, he reached down and picked it up. Inside was a set of car keys, along with a passport and several credit cards. He recognized the name printed on the front page—Sylvia Ritter—but otherwise nothing registered. There was also a folded piece of paper tucked between the pages, and he pulled it out to read what was written upon it.
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. You deserved better than me. Please know that your life meant more to me than my own. If only we could've met somewhere else, someplace safer, maybe things would have turned out differently. Maybe you wouldn't have died because of me. I wish I could take it back. Goodbye, Sylvia. Thank you for giving me such wonderful memories.
He let goof the note and stared at it for a moment, trying to understand why she'd done what she'd done. Was there another man involved? Had they planned to run off together?

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
"I'm sorry, ma'am," the first officer said to the woman in the lifeboat. "We're going to have to cut you out of that seat.""It's okay, son," she told him. "Just let me stay here until my husband comes back for me. I'll be fine.""But—"the first officer began again, and then stopped when he saw her face."You've got a baby with you?" he asked.
She nodded.
He looked at the other passengers. They were all watching them now. The captain was still on his knees,holding onto the side of the boat as if it might float away."Who are they? What do we do?" someone called from inside the cabin.
"They're Americans," one of the women shouted. "And what can we do about it?We're just lucky we weren't killed by those things!"
The second officer turned to look at the man who had been sitting next to the first officer. He was staring down into the water,his eyes wide open. His mouth hung agape."What is it?" the second officer asked.
The man didn't answer.Instead,he took off running toward the stern of the ship.
The second officer started after him. Then he heard something behind him—a sound like a huge wave breaking against an ocean liner.When he turned around,the ship was gone. And so was everyone else aboard except for the two people in the lifeboats.The woman in the front row pointed up at the sky. There was a trail of smoke rising above the horizon. It quickly grew larger and darker.Within seconds,it became obvious that the smoke wasn't coming from any sort of fire but rather from the base of a gigantic creature that rose from the sea below."Oh my God!Look!" the woman screamed. "Look at that thing!"A moment later,she fell silent. The men standing beside her also stared upward. In fact,they seemed transfixed. One of them suddenly bent over backwardand threw up.

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
"Go!" she screamed, pointing to the shoreline. "Get out of here! Go now!""I can't leave you—"
She slapped him across the face and pushed him toward the water. He stumbled into it, but managed to keep his footing.The first wave took him down in a rush of bubbles. He felt something brush past his leg as he sank beneath the surface. A shark? Then there was nothing more.The ocean swallowed him up like an old friend.He bobbed back up just long enough for one last glimpse at her before sinking again.She stood alone on the beach, staring after him.Then she turned around and walked away.* * *
"You're sure about this?" Darryl asked. The sun had set hours ago and they were still waiting for Jack's return from the mainland.They'd been sitting in silence since then, each lost in their own thoughts.Jack nodded. It wasn't much farther by boat than walking along the coast. He couldn't wait any longer.They would make it.Darryl glanced over at Kelly. She looked pale, even under all that makeup. Maybe she should have stayed behind with them. But no.They needed someone who knew how to handle herself when things got dangerous.Besides, she'd be safer if they made it back alive.And they would.He hoped so.Because without her...** *
Kelly heard the screams before she saw anything else.There was shouting coming from somewhere near the hotel.And people running through the streets. Something terrible must have happened.A few minutes later, two police officers appeared on the street leading to the beach.One pointed off toward the sea while the other ran toward the group gathered around the edge of the pool.
It was only then that Kelly realized what was happening."Oh my God," she said softly. There were too many bodies floating in the surf. Too many pieces of debris scattered throughout the sand.And the sharks weren't done yet. They circled lazily above the wreckage, watching their prey.Somebody called out a warning—a cry of terror—but nobody paid attention.

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
"You have to stop this!" said the man, his voice strained with effort as he tried to control a raging fire in his lungs. "They're going after my son!My baby boy is out there and they can't wait another minute.They'll kill him before I get there."
"Calm down," she ordered. "I'm here now. What's your name?"He stared at her for a moment, then took a deep breath. He looked exhausted but determined. "Mark Davis."
"Let me see if we can help you calm down first."She stood up from behind the desk. "Please sit back down on that couch. Can you do that? Just take it easy until I've got some water ready for you."Shewalked around the desk toward the kitchen area of the office. She heard Mark sighing deeply as she entered the room and saw the two men sitting on the couch staring at her with open mouths. "Sorry about all the noise,"she apologized, turning offthe radio. "It was just an accident. But I think maybe I know what happened."Mark nodded slowly, still not looking away from her face. "Yeah, I guess you'd better believe it. They went nuts when they found the bodies."
"Who are 'they'?" asked Marjorie.
"Some guys who live nearby," answered one of the other men. "They were fishing right next door to where those sharks came ashore.Must have been about three or four miles offshore. A couple of them had gone over there to check things out. That's why they were late getting home."Marjorie turned back to Mark. "What did these fishermen say exactly?"Mark shrugged slightly. "Well...it wasn't much really.Just that their boat must have run into something big because it capsized, spilling them overboard and leaving them stranded in the shallows while the sharks tore them apart.And the way they described it..." His eyes shifted downward. "...well, it sounded like they didn't make it.""Didn't make it? How come they didn't call 911?"
Mark shook his head. "No phone service out there. And no cell phones either."He paused again. "We were trying to find someone else to contact, but nobody would go near the place."
"So how long ago was this?"asked Marjorie.

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
"I'm not going to make it, Alex," she said. "If you don't want me to die alone on this godforsaken island... I'll take the pills.""You're a tough girl." He took her hand in his and squeezed gently.She looked up at him with eyes that were filled with tears but also held an expression of peace he had never seen before."Alex..." She swallowed hard. "Will you do something for me?"He nodded. "Anything." "When we get back home, will you marry me? Please?""Yes!" he exclaimed, squeezing her hand tightly again as they watched the ocean's horizon turn from black to gray.⁂

Note: This is part one of three chapters. If you have read any previous stories by me, then all parts are connected (in some way).For those who haven't yet read anything by me, there may be spoilers ahead.For more information about what you can expect from future installments, check out the author page here.Chapter 1 - The First Day of School
It was September 3rd, 2018. My name is Emma Rolston and I am a senior in high school.As far as I know, I've been friends with Rachel since kindergarten. We went through middle school together and now we're both seniors.

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
They had to be stopped before they got any closer, but the boat was too far away for them to make it in time with their current speed."There's no way we can outrun these things," he said into his radio. "We need a distraction.""I'm on it!" said Chris as she ran back toward the cabin and grabbed her laptop computer from its place under the desk."What are you doing?" asked Dr. Diaz."You're going to love this," said Chris, typing furiously at the keyboard."Chris! You don't have time—" started Dr. Diaz.
"It'll only take me a second or two.Just hang tight until I get done here," replied Chris as she continued tapping keys. A moment later, the screen lit up with an image of the sea monster that Chris had captured earlier.She clicked play, then zoomed in on the creature so that everyone watching could see what she saw.A giant maw filled the monitor; teeth like spears jutted outward from both sides of its mouth.The jaws were open wide enough to swallow the ship whole. As the video played, the giant fish swam forward, closing its gaping mouth over the side of the yacht.The ocean water sprayed upward, soaking everything within reach.
Dr. Diaz watched helplessly as the yacht began sinking beneath the waves. He heard Chris yelling through the speakers."Everyone! Grab onto something solid—NOW!"
He looked around frantically. The deckhands who'd been standing by near the bow suddenly dropped to the floor.Dr. Diaz did likewise, though not without some difficulty. His hands slipped off one of the handrails and he almost fell overboard himself.Then all hell broke loose.

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
They would have to be careful not to spook the sharks, but they had no choice. The great whites were coming for them."We'll go down together," said Chantal. "I'm going to try and get a line on her."
Bobby nodded. He knew she was right.They'd been lucky so far—they hadn't even gotten scratched by one of those razor-sharp teeth.But it wouldn't last much longer. They needed something better than luck. If he couldn't kill the shark with his knife, maybe there was another way...
"Hold up!" yelled Bobby."She's circling back around! I think we're in trouble again!"
Chantal looked at him as if he were crazy. "What are you talking about?We just got out of that mess. You know what this means?"
"Yeah," said Bobby.He turned toward the boat.
There was a loud splash from behind them.A wave broke over the stern and washed away two feet of decking. Something big hit the water beside them. It splashed into the ocean and disappeared beneath the waves."That thing is huge!" shouted Chantal.
Then an enormous fin rose above the surface and headed straight for them.It came within twenty yards before veering off course.Then it circled back. Another pass followed, then another.And another after that.
Chantal grabbed Bobby's arm. She pointed to where the creature swam alongside their boat. "Look! There's more of them!"Bobby watched as three or four more fins cut through the sea.Somehow they knew exactly where the boat was. And why should they care?Their target wasn't here anymore."This isn't good," said Bobby.
"No kidding," said Chantal.
"Let me see your spear gun," said Bobby.
"Why?"asked Chantal.
"Just do it."
Chantal fumbled inside her duffel bag until she found the weapon. Then she handed it to Bobby.He pulled the trigger. A stream of darts shot from the barrel. They struck the first shark dead center between its eyes.

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
They had to be stopped.
"We have a problem," the captain said, pointing at one of his men who was carrying an unconscious crewman into sick bay. "He's dead."The first mate stepped forward and knelt down beside the man. He pulled back the collar of the sailor's uniform shirt, revealing a gaping hole in the center of his chest.The man's eyes were open, staring blankly up toward the ceiling as he struggled for breath. His hands twitched spasmodically against the floor.The first mate placed them gently on either side of his head.
A moment passed before the first mate spoke again. "He died from a single stab wound just below the heart."Captain Taylor looked over at the other members of the team. They all appeared confused by what they saw. The first mate stood, brushing off his pants."I'm sorry, gentlemen, but we need to get out of here now."
"What about our mission?"the captain asked.
"There is no longer any reason to stay.We can't risk it."
Taylor nodded once, then turned away. "Take us home."The first mate gave him a curt nod and led them through the hatchway and out onto the deck. A strong wind blew across their faces. It smelled like rain.The sky overhead was dark with clouds. The ship began moving slowly backward, away from the island.As the last member of the expedition came aboard, Captain Taylor went belowdecks to find the rest of his team.* * *
Ricky woke up feeling groggy. He tried to sit up and discovered that someone had tied him to a chair.His arms were bound behind his back.As soon as he realized where he was, Ricky started struggling. "Let me go!"he yelled. But the only response was silence. Then there was movement nearby. Someone walked past him.The room faded around him.
"Hey! What are you doing?

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
"I've got to get back," he said, "or the others will come looking for me." He turned and ran toward the water's edge. The tide was coming in quickly now,dragging him down with it.
"Wait!" I shouted after him. But then something grabbed my ankle from behind.It felt like a huge hand of steel wrapped around my leg.Before I knew what was happening, I had been pulled off my feet into the surf. As I went under, all I saw were flashes of red light as the ocean closed over my head.* * *
There are times when you feel your life slipping away from you.You're going through some kind of tunnel that seems endless—and yet there is no way out at its end. A voice inside tells you not to give up; another one says it's hopeless.You can't breathe because the air has gone foul. And still another voice whispers: This isn't real. It's just an illusion. Just part of the nightmare...But I couldn't let go of reality. Not this time.
Something dragged me underwater again. My lungs burned. I kicked hard against the creature holding on to me. For a moment,we struggled together. Then it released me, leaving me gasping in the dark depths. I heard voices above me, calling out for help. Something else came swimming down toward us.An immense shadow moved across the surface of the sea. It loomed over me. I opened my mouth to scream but nothing came out. There was too much pressure in my chest.My vision blurred. I tried to move, to swim upward, but I couldn't force myself to take even a single breath. Everything became blackness.Darkness everywhere...
When I woke up,the first thing I realizedwas that I wasn't drowning anymore. Instead,I lay sprawled out on the floorof a small cabin.Aboveme was a skylight coveredwith heavy drapes. Throughthem I could see the blue sky.
A man stood next to me.He looked familiar.His hairwas short and his beard neatlytrimmed. He worekhaki pants and a white shirtthat buttoned up the front.His eyes were gray. They helda look of concern."Are you okay?"he asked. His accent was British.
"Where am I? What happenedto me?"
"We'll talk about that later," he told me.

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
"I'll be damned," said the man, his voice shaking as he stared out at the water. "It's a goddamn sea monster.""You're not making any sense, sir!" yelled someone else from inside the boat. "What do you mean it was an alien?""Look for yourself! It's got to be some kind of giant fish or something... maybe even a whale..."A few minutes later, one of the men on board shouted that they'd spotted another massive creature in the distance.Two days after the first sighting, two more vessels were attacked by what appeared to be large sharks.All three boats managed to get away without being sunk and made their way back toward land. Once there, however, each crewman claimed that he had seen a gigantic white shark following them.After hearing about these incidents, the mayor ordered all ships within ten miles of shore evacuated immediately. He also warned people to stay indoors during daylight hours while warning sirens blared across town.Word quickly spread throughout the state and beyond, with many fearing a new attack by the legendary beast rumored to have been responsible for the deaths of over twenty thousand sailors since 1818.But despite the panic caused by the sightings, no further attacks occurred.
In fact, most residents who lived along the coast seemed relieved when the summer ended. The warm weather lasted well into October,allowing tourists to visit the area once again.
