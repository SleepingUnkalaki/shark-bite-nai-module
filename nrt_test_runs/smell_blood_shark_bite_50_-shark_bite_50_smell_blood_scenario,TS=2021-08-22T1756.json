A gentle breeze blew through the leaves, rustling their branches. His head hurt like hell; he opened one eye to see if anything looked familiar, then shut it quickly. Everything did look familiar—the sand underfoot, the feel of the cool wind against his face, even the taste of salt in his mouth. But something wasn't right. Something was missing...\nThen he remembered. They'd died together, swimming for shore after being swept away by an unexpected storm surge.\nThey hadn't drowned, though. At least, not completely. She must have dragged him ashore somehow, and now they lay sprawled across each other's arms, exhausted from their struggle to survive. It seemed impossible that they'd made it here alive. How long had they been unconscious? Hours? Days? Weeks? Time didn't mean much anymore. All that mattered was waking up here, safe on dry land.\nHis hand found hers first, and he squeezed gently before opening both eyes fully. Her skin felt warm beneath his palm, which meant she might be breathing. Then he noticed the blood staining her shirt, so he rolled onto his back and saw what else had survived: her pack, lying next to his own. The straps had broken free during the swim, leaving everything inside scattered about the sand. Most important, however, was the small leather case sitting open beside her hip.\nShe'd left it behind.\nCautiously, he reached down and picked it up. Inside was a set of car keys, along with a passport and several credit cards. He recognized the name printed on the front page—Sylvia Ritter—but otherwise nothing registered. There was also a folded piece of paper tucked between the pages, and he pulled it out to read what was written upon it.\nI'm sorry I couldn't protect you. You deserved better than me. Please know that your life meant more to me than my own. If only we could've met somewhere else, someplace safer, maybe things would have turned out differently. Maybe you wouldn't have died because of me. I wish I could take it back. Goodbye, Sylvia.

Once there, however, each crewman claimed that he had seen a gigantic white shark following them.After hearing about these incidents, the mayor ordered all ships within ten miles of shore evacuated immediately. He also warned people to stay indoors during daylight hours while warning sirens blared across town.Word quickly spread throughout the state and beyond, with many fearing a new attack by the legendary beast rumored to have been responsible for the deaths of over twenty thousand sailors since 1818.But despite the panic caused by the sightings, no further attacks occurred.\nIn fact, most residents who lived along the coast seemed relieved when the summer ended. The warm weather lasted well into October,allowing tourists to visit the area once again.",
