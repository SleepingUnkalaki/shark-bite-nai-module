  "result": "I don't know, it was like the shark attacked them or something. I mean, they were just standing there in the water when it happened... It was really scary! The thing was huge; you could see its teeth from where we were sitting on the boat. And then it came up out of the water right next to them and started biting at their legs. They screamed for a while but nothing worked — the shark kept coming closer and closer until finally one of them managed to grab hold of the other's leg and pull him into the boat. Then he jumped back over the side before the shark reached him again. But that was no good because now the shark had grabbed onto his arm instead and wouldn't let go. So he took off running towards us with this big bloody gash down his forearm. He didn't make it very far though, because as soon as he got close enough to reach the safety rope hanging from our boat, the shark bit through both of his arms and pulled him under. We all watched in horror as he disappeared beneath the surface. After what seemed like forever, we heard some splashing noises so we looked around and saw him bobbing up and down about twenty yards away. He'd swum clear of the shark somehow and made it safely to shore.\nBut by then, the shark had already moved on, probably looking for another victim. That was why the three men hadn't been able to get back aboard after being bitten: they couldn't swim fast enough. One of the guys who was still stuck in the water shouted at me to throw him my knife, which I did, and then I helped drag the others up onto the deck. When we realised how bad their wounds were, we called an ambulance straightaway. Luckily none of them died, although two of them needed quite extensive reconstructive surgery. The third guy lost both his hands. As if that wasn't bad enough, apparently he has only limited use of his left hand now, even though it looks perfectly normal. His wife is absolutely devastated. She says she'll never be able to have kids now.\nAfterwards we went home and told everyone what had happened. No one believed us at first, not even the police. We're pretty sure that's because they thought we must've done something ourselves to cause such a horrible accident. All the same, they decided to send divers out to look for any more bodies, but unfortunately they found none. Apparently they think whoever sent those sharks might try it again sometime, so the coastguard are keeping watch over the area. At least we can sleep soundly knowing there won't be any further attacks.\nSo tell me, do you believe us?\n\"No,\" said Eloise. \"I don't.\"\nTheysat there in silence for a moment, watching the sun rise over the ocean, listening to the gentle lapping of waves against the hulls of their boats.",

And then it came up out of the water right next to them and started biting at their legs. They screamed for a while but nothing worked — the shark kept coming closer and closer until finally one of them managed to grab hold of the other's leg and pull him into the boat.

He didn't make it very far though, because as soon as he got close enough to reach the safety rope hanging from our boat, the shark bit through both of his arms and pulled him under.

What do you mean?\"Ron: \"It's a long story, but I saw this movie once about these two guys who got attacked by great white sharks in the middle of the ocean.They were swimming along when all of a sudden they see something coming towards them—a big fin—and it turns out to be one of those giant prehistoric monsters from Jurassic Park or whatever—\"\n\"Or Jaws,\" says Hermione.\n\"—yeah, that was it!Anyway, so they swim away as fast as they can and then the monster comes after them again, only this time it has more teeth!\"Hermione laughs at his lame joke. \"You know what else is funny?\" she asks.\"The way your eyes are bugging out right now... like you've just seen some kind of horrible vision...\" She gives him a playful nudge on the shoulder.He shrugs her off. \"Okay, okay, forget I said anything.\" He looks over at me. \"So, uh, any idea where we're going next?\" he asks.I look down at my watch. It's almost midnight. The last ferry back to San Francisco leaves for the mainland around ten o'clock tomorrow morning.We need to find somewhere safe to spend the night before we get there.\nWe walk through town until we come across a large hotel called the Inn at Sea.There's no sign outside; instead, a neon arrow points toward its front door.

There was something out there — a big shadow, maybe fifty feet from one end of the boat to the other.It looked like a giant killer whale or some kind of sea monster. Then we saw its head coming up over the side of the boat.It had these huge teeth...and they came right at us. We started screaming. And then...\" He paused for effect. \"...the thing went down again.\"Parish'svoice trailed off as he stared into space. For several seconds he sat quietly, his eyes focused on nothing.Then he seemed to snap back to reality.\"Anyway, after that I decided not to go swimming anymore until someone told me where all those stories about great white sharks going crazy were true.\" He laughed nervously.\"So I never did swim again.\"\nThe story made no sense to Dr. Walker. The man obviously believed every word he'd just spoken.It sounded like a tale of terror straight out of Jaws. But she didn't believe him.

The teeth were white instead of black or brown.And its eyes... they weren't normal either. They glowed red at night. When we got closer to shore, it turned away from us and swam toward land.\"What is that?\" asked Hermione. \"It looks different.\"\"That's what I thought,\" said Hagrid quietly. He had been quiet all evening, as if he didn't want anyone to know about his past.\"But there isn't much time left for me now. And anyway, you'll never believe this...\"He looked around at them.There was no one else in the room. \"This is where I used to live. This is my home.\"Hagridtook out a piece of parchment and drew on it. \"See? There are two trees outside my window.That's my bedroom over there. See how the sun shines through their branches? Well, last summer, just after sunset, something happened that made me realize how special these trees really are.\"Harrycould see that Hagrid was looking very nervous; he seemed almost afraid to go on. But finally he did speak again.\"You remember the first task set by Lord Voldemort — the Triwizard Tournament? You don' t, do you? Well, Dumbledore told me about it.You have to get into three school houses without being caught.\"Hagrid pointed at each tree. \"The leaves are divided exactly halfway down between top and bottom.That means that if you can climb up the trunk of one of those trees, you're right under your house!That's why the Ministry doesn' t bother with them anymore.They've always known which ones are safe.\"A small smile crossed his face.",

They stopped to investigate, but there was nothing to be seen except for some large fish that were jumping around.Then, from behind them came another sound—the unmistakable roar of a shark!The two friends looked at each other nervously as they swam back toward shore. When they got close enough to see the rocks on the beach, both boys turned and ran up onto land.\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Hermione Granger, who'd joined them. \"Did you hear something?\"\nHarry shook his head. He didn't want to tell her what he thought it might have been.Instead, he pointed out into the water.\"Look,\" he said quietly.\nRon stared where he was pointing and then gasped.A giant fin cut through the waves not far away. It rose above the surface like a wall, its edges curling upward and downward, before disappearing again beneath the sea.The creature was enormous... bigger than any shark Harry had ever seen.It circled once over their heads, leaving them feeling shaken and frightened.Then it dived down below the water and disappeared.\nThey stood silently staring at one another until Hermione broke the silence. \"Well, I'm going home now.Don't wait up!\" She waved good-bye to them and set off along the path back to Privet Drive.The three boys watched her go.Then Ron spoke first.\"I don't think we should stay here too long.We're attracting attention...\"\nHe took hold of Harry's arm.Harry glanced at him anxiously.If anything else attacked them, they would need help quickly. But just then, someone appeared beside them.Hermione had returned.She walked right past without saying hello or even looking at them.Her eyes were fixed straight ahead.\n\"Come on,\" she whispered urgently. \"Let's get inside before anyone sees us.\"",
