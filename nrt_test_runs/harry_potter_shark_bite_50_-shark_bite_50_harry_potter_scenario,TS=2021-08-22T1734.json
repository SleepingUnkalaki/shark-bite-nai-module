  "result": "\"I don't know how they're going to react,\" said Zephyr. \"They'll be nervous.\" She turned back toward the beach, her eyes fixed on the water. The waves were breaking in a gentle rhythm onto the sand. A few gulls swooped over the surf line as if searching for something interesting below.\nZephyr felt a sudden urge to run down the path that led from the dunes into the forest of mangroves. It was too late now; she could not change what had happened—she would have to face it soon enough. But at least she could leave this place before things got any worse. Before someone died because of her or her friends. She glanced around one last time. There was nothing but sea and sky and white-capped ocean beyond the breakers. No sign of danger. No sound except for the distant cries of seagulls. Nothing but peace. Peace and beauty.\nThen she saw him. He stood just inside the trees, his body outlined by sunlight filtering through the foliage above. His hair hung loose about his shoulders, framing his ruggedly handsome features. He wore khaki shorts and a tank top, and he carried a spear gun in one hand. As she watched, he lowered himself into a crouch and raised the weapon high overhead, then brought it crashing down on the ground, making the earth tremble beneath their feet. Then he began walking away, following the trail deeper into the woods.\nShe followed after him.\n* * *\nHarry sat up, shaking off the dream. His head still throbbed. He reached out blindly and found the side rail of the bed. He swung his legs over the edge and rose slowly to his knees. The room spun slightly when he tried to stand, but he steadied himself against the wall. Slowly, carefully, he made his way across the cabin until he came to the door leading outside. He pushed open the glass panel and stepped into the bright morning sunshine.\nHe blinked hard several times, trying to clear his vision. After a moment, he realized he wasn't alone. A woman dressed in jeans and T-shirt stood near the railing. Her long blond hair fell past her waist, and she gazed out at the ocean. She seemed so peaceful, so content, that Harry almost forgot why he'd awakened.\nThe sun's rays cast shadows upon her skin as she leaned forward, pressing her hands together tightly. Then she looked directly at him. For some reason, Harry thought he recognized her. And even more strangely, he knew who she really was.\n\"You've been staring at me,\" said the girl. \"Did you forget my name?\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Harry. \"Whoare—\"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" interrupted the girl. \"We need to talk.\"\n\"About what?\" asked Harry.\n\"Us,\" answered the girl. \"And your friend...",

  "result": "It was the third day of their trip. They had been swimming for about three hours, keeping a steady pace but not getting anywhere near land. The water temperature hovered around 60 degrees Fahrenheit.It would have felt warm to someone who wasn't accustomed to it. But the two teenagers were used to cold temperatures; they could handle this one easily.They had swam west from the beach where they'd left their gear.Their main goal today was to see if there were any dolphins in the area. If so, that meant they might be able to get some footage of them jumping out of the ocean.Harry was first into the water. He surfaced after only thirty seconds. \"There's nothing here,\" he said.\"Let me try over there.\"Hedove down again. This time he stayed under for five minutes before surfacing. When he did, his mouth opened wide as though he was screaming something at the top of his lungs.Ron heard him and looked toward shore. There was no sign of Harry. Then he saw what appeared to be a large shark moving rapidly away from the shoreline. It was heading straight toward them.\"Shark!\" yelled Harry.He dove below the surface, then popped up right next to Ron. His eyes seemed to glow white. He pointed across the open sea.A school of fish were zooming back and forth between the boat and the island they had just passed. \"Look!Look at those big ones!\" shouted Harry excitedly.The fish moved closer to shore. Their bodies glistened silver and gold in the sunlight.Even when they came close enough to touch, they kept on going.Then suddenly the entire school disappeared beneath the waves. A few moments later, Harry grabbed Ron by the shoulder and pulled him underwater.When they broke through the surface, both boys gasped. One hundred feet ahead of them lay a pod of killer whales.As soon as they got within fifty yards of the orcas, they began leaping high above the water. Some of them even jumped clear over the heads of the teens.As far as Harry knew,orcas hadn't been seen off the coast of North America since World War II. But now he could hear them singing—a sound unlike anything he had ever heard before.It was beautiful music,haunting and sad at the same time.It made his heart ache.\n\"I've never heard anything like that,\" said Ron quietly.Harry nodded.",

    "A school of fish were zooming back and forth between the boat and the island they had just passed. \"Look!",
    "Look at those big ones!\" shouted Harry excitedly.The fish moved closer to shore. Their bodies glistened silver and gold in the sunlight.",
    "Even when they came close enough to touch, they kept on going.Then suddenly the entire school disappeared beneath the waves. A few moments later, Harry grabbed Ron by the shoulder and pulled him underwater.",
    "When they broke through the surface, both boys gasped. One hundred feet ahead of them lay a pod of killer whales.",
    "As soon as they got within fifty yards of the orcas, they began leaping high above the water. Some of them even jumped clear over the heads of the teens.As far as Harry knew,",
    "orcas hadn't been seen off the coast of North America since World War II. But now he could hear them singing—a sound unlike anything he had ever heard before.It was beautiful music,",
    "haunting and sad at the same time.It made his heart ache.\n\"I've never heard anything like that,\" said Ron quietly.Harry nodded."
