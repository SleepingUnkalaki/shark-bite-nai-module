{"scenarioVersion":1,"title":"Shark Bite 40 Need Help","description":"","prompt":"I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap.

One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.\nI hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, \"","tags":[],"context":[{"text":"","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":0,"budgetPriority":800,"trimDirection":"trimBottom","insertionType":"newline","maximumTrimType":"sentence","insertionPosition":0}},{"text":"","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":2048,"budgetPriority":-400,"trimDirection":"trimBottom","insertionType":"newline","maximumTrimType":"sentence","insertionPosition":-4}}],"ephemeralContext":[],"placeholders":[],"settings":{"parameters":{"temperature":0.55,"max_length":40,"min_length":1,"top_k":140,"top_p":0.9,"tail_free_sampling":1,"repetition_penalty":3.5,"repetition_penalty_range":1024,"repetition_penalty_slope":6.57,"bad_words_ids":[]},"preset":"","trimResponses":true,"banBrackets":true,"prefix":"6B-v3:19e0cca04f968a0c344017e6cb260cce7a500486fd75bdf87c7d16e1bf2506d1:bd8ef2e4d829c905b4a8c59945a464025fb25b557d3bf889142da5afd11a457f","aiModule":{"id":"6B-v3:19e0cca04f968a0c344017e6cb260cce7a500486fd75bdf87c7d16e1bf2506d1:bd8ef2e4d829c905b4a8c59945a464025fb25b557d3bf889142da5afd11a457f","name":"Shark Bite 2021.08.22_40","description":"Shark Bite 2021.08.22_40","remoteId":""}},"lorebook":{"lorebookVersion":3,"entries":[],"settings":{"orderByKeyLocations":false},"categories":[]},"author":"","storyContextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":512,"budgetPriority":0,"trimDirection":"trimTop","insertionType":"newline","maximumTrimType":"sentence","insertionPosition":-1},"contextDefaults":{"ephemeralDefaults":[{"text":"","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":2048,"budgetPriority":-10000,"trimDirection":"doNotTrim","insertionType":"newline","maximumTrimType":"newline","insertionPosition":-2},"startingStep":1,"delay":0,"duration":1,"repeat":false,"reverse":false}],"loreDefaults":[{"text":"","contextConfig":{"prefix":"","suffix":"\n","tokenBudget":2048,"reservedTokens":0,"budgetPriority":400,"trimDirection":"trimBottom","insertionType":"newline","maximumTrimType":"sentence","insertionPosition":-1},"lastUpdatedAt":1629666894700,"displayName":"New Lorebook Entry","id":"a982b7d6-c903-455a-97fb-2b92290e73e8","keys":[],"searchRange":1000,"enabled":true,"forceActivation":false,"keyRelative":false,"nonStoryActivatable":false,"category":""}]}}
