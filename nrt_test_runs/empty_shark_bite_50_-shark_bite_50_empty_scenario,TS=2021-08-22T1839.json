Her voice sounded small and frightened. \"We're not moving.\"\nHildemara felt panic rising inside her. They could float for hours without being able to see anything.

They climbed aboard and took up positions at either end of the cabin.They waited for several minutes, then heard what sounded like heavy footsteps coming from belowdecks. The steps stopped just above the floorboards.Then someone began climbing out through the hatchway—a man with long hair tied behind his head. He stepped onto the deck wearing a gray suit and carrying an overnight bag over one shoulder.He looked around slowly before raising his eyes to meet Leandro's.Leandro kept his gun trained on him until he recognized the face.\n\"You?\"\nRafael nodded. His voice was calm, almost indifferent.\n\"What are you doing here?How did you find us?\"\n\"Your father hired me to help you get away.\" Rafael turned to look at Raul. \"And I found your sister instead.\"\"My sister is dead!\" Raul shouted. \"Her body washed ashore yesterday afternoon! What do you want from me now?\"\n\"Nothing, really.Just wanted to see how things went with you.\"\nRafael opened his suitcase and pulled out some clothes. Then he walked into the bathroom and started taking off his wet suit.\"Where are we going?\" Leandro asked.\n\"Back home, where else?\" Rafael answered. \"To my place. You'll be safe there.\"\n\"Safe?From whom?\"\"Don't worry about it. Just let me know when you're ready.\"\nLeandro glanced at Raul again. \"Do you have enough money to pay for our passage?\"\"Yes. But first, tell me why you came after us.\"\n\"Because you killed my brother-in-law.\"\nRafael shook his head.\"No, you got it all wrong. My brother-in-law died trying to save me. It was only because of him that I survived.\"\nRaul stared at him blankly.\"It's true,\" Rafael continued. \"His name was Juan Lopez. We worked together at the same construction site in Mexico City.One day, he told me he'd seen something strange in the ocean. A creature...something big...\" Rafael paused. \"A giant shark.\"\n\"So you followed him,\" Raul said.",

  "result": "\"What are you doing?\" said the first officer, as he watched his friend pull on a pair of rubber gloves. \"You can't go out there.\"Alyson ignored him and pulled her mask over her head. She looked at the officer in surprise, then nodded to herself. The first officer shrugged and went back inside the cabin.Alyson grabbed one of the life jackets from the rack near the door and put it on before stepping into the water.As she stepped onto the boat's deck, she felt something brush against her legs. When she turned around, she saw that the shark was still following them.A moment later, it dove under the surface of the ocean. Alyson followed its movements with her eyes until she lost sight of it beneath the waves.When she reached the end of the dock,Alyson jumped off the boat and ran toward shore, holding the life jacket tightly against her chest.As she walked through the sand, she kept looking behind her for any sign of the great white shark. When she finally made it to the beach, she collapsed onto the warm wet sand.A few minutes later, the sun began to set in the sky above.\nShe lay there staring up at the darkening sky while the sound of crashing surf filled her ears. In the distance,she could hear people yelling about sharks being spotted all along the coast. As night fell, Alyson decided that she had better find shelter somewhere.She got to her feet and started walking down the beach when suddenly she heard someone call her name.It took several seconds for her to realize who it was.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she whispered as she turned around. \"Please don't be mad.\"Theman standing next to her smiled gently.\n\"No need to apologize, Alyson.\" He extended his hand. \"My name is Dr. Joshua Jaffe.\"He shook her hand firmly. \"Pleased to meet you.\"\n\"Likewise,\" she replied. \"But why did you come after me? I mean...why didn't you just leave me alone?\"Jaffe gave her a reassuring smile. \"Because we've been watching your house ever since you moved here. We knew what was going to happen today.",
