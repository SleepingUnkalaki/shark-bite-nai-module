=== Prompt ========================================
I need help. I'm not sure what's going on with me, but it's driving me crazy. After looking through the web, I found a Dr. Michael Szozas, who is a renowned psychiatrist and counselor.  Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.
Dr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.
I'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, "Come on in!"
I step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.
The first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, "I'm glad to see you," he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.
"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here," he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.  His hazel eyes fixate upon me, drinking and studying every detail of me as he waits for my response.
I hesitate, and sit down on the couch, and I respond, "

=== Iteration 0     ==============================
My name is Tristan Walker."
He nods slowly, then leans forward, placing both elbows onto his knees. "And why have you contacted me?"
I pause again, thinking before answering, "Well, uh... I guess because I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and I don't know what else to do. My mind keeps replaying all this stuff that happened today, and I can't stop thinking about it. It's just driving me nuts. And I really need help. I think I might be losing control of myself, or something..."
Dr. Szozas smiles, and looks up at the ceiling, "OK, let's start there, shall we? Tell me more about what you're experiencing, specifically, and anything else that may be relevant."
I tell him about the accident, and how I feel guilty about killing two people. How I'm afraid I'll kill somebody else if I'm not careful. That I keep seeing their faces everywhere. He listens intently, nodding along with my story, and occasionally asking questions. When I finish, he asks me to close my eyes and relax. After a moment, his voice comes softly, "Do you remember the last time you saw them?"
I shake my head, confused, "No. What are you talking about?"
Dr. Szozas responds, "Just relax. Take a deep breath, and exhale. Let your worries go, and allow your thoughts to drift away, and focus only on the sound of my voice. Do you hear the ocean waves outside the window, or perhaps the wind blowing through the trees?"
I nod, still puzzled, but I begin to concentrate. I breathe deeply, listening to the sounds. The ocean, the breeze, the rustle of leaves. I feel the coolness of the air, and I sense the warmth of the sun. I become aware that I am sitting on a comfortable chair, the smell of a floral scent fills the room, and I feel the touch of the soft fabric against my skin. I open my eyes, and I am alone.
Dr. Szozas stands up, and walks over to the window, and I watch his back. His body is so slim and trim, the muscles rippling beneath his shirt. I find myself wondering what it would be like to run my hands over his skin. I wonder about his hair, and his eyes, those hazel eyes that seem to drink me in. I am mesmerized by his movements, the way he moves his arms, the fluidity of his gait, the gracefulness of his stride. I want to follow him, to be with him, to be a part of his life.
He turns around, and he issmiling, and he says, "Did you feel that, Tristan?"
I shrug, and say, "Feel what?"
"That was a telepathic connection.

=== Iteration 1     ==============================
My name is Samantha Jacobs." I pause, wondering if I should tell him all about myself, but then decide against it, "and I came because..." I trail off, unsure where this leads,but wanting desperately to get to know him better, "because I think there might be something wrong with me... or maybe I'm just losing my mind?"He laughs, a deep rich chuckle that makes me smile back at him, "No worries, Sammie, we'll figure it out together." And he pats the spot next to him,invitingly.
We talk for hours. We discuss our families, our jobs, our lives. He asks questions, he listens, and he smiles.At one point during the conversation, I ask if he thinks I have schizophrenia.
"Well, Sammie, that's a good question.You've been having problems, and I want to help. But let me start by telling you what it is that I do.My specialty is treating people with mental illness, which includes a wide range of disorders and conditions. It also includes those with a variety of other medical issues, such as diabetes and heart disease.My patients come from all different backgrounds: wealthy, poor, young, old, male, female; I treat everyone equally."I nod, and say, "So, I guess you'd call me schizophrenic?"
Dr. Szozas looks at me with a gentle expression, "Let me explain.Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder, meaning that it tends to persist throughout life.It is characterized by symptoms that include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and/or grossly inappropriate behavior.The cause is unknown; however, research indicates that genetics, environment, and biological factors may play a role.
The onset is usually between the ages of 15 and 25.

=== Iteration 2     ==============================
My name is Erica Sutter."
He nods, and then asks, "And where do you live?"
Oh god... this is really happening.My heart races faster than ever before in my life. I tell him, "In San Diego."
"San Diego? Is that near Los Angeles?" he inquires.
"Yes sir,it is."
"Do you have any family there?" he asks next.
"No, not anymore."
"That's too bad. Why did they leave?""Well, uh..."
"Did something happen? Do you want to talk about it?"
This guy is good.I feel safe talking to him, and I know that whatever happens, I can trust him.
"I guess I don't really understand what happened, but I think my husband cheated on me.My daughter caught them together, and she called me, and we had a huge fight, and now I'm not speaking to her. She doesn't even want anything to do with me.And I just found out that my ex-husband is dating another woman, and I haven't spoken to him since I left the house last night. It's been a very difficult day."Dr.Szozas smiles, "Wow, I wish I could say I was surprised, but I wasn't. How long ago was the divorce finalized?""A little less than three years, I believe. They were married for eight years."
"So, you've lived alone for a while, right?"
"Uh huh, yes,I moved into the apartment after the divorce was final, and I've been living there by myself ever since. My parents died a few months ago, and my sister lives a couple hours away.I'm all alone."
"You said that you have no friends or relatives nearby, correct?"
"None that I would call close.I keep busy, and I work hard, and I get along well with my neighbors, but I never really socialize with anyone.I was raised to be a loner, and I prefer it that way."
"Is that a problem, being a loner?""Not at all, it makes me happy to be able to spend time with myself. I enjoy reading, watching movies, listening to music, taking walks, and cooking.I love to garden; I grow most of my own food, and I take care of the flowers in my courtyard.

=== Iteration 3     ==============================
My name is Victoria Rivenbark."
He nods, waiting patiently, then asks, "And why have you come?"
"Well..."My mind races, trying to think of something intelligent and interesting enough to tell this distinguished gentleman, "I guess because... I feel lost? Confused?Not sure what to do next? And I don't know where else to turn.""Hmmmmm,"he ponders, "so you came to me because you want help finding answers?"
"Yes, exactly!" I say excitedly.
"That's good.That shows initiative. Tell me more about you."
So I begin telling him all about myself: My life growing up, school, friends, family, and my career path. As I talk,he listens intently, nodding now and again, making notes in his notepad. When I finish, he looks up at me and smiles, "You seem very normal to me.I'm going to ask you a few questions, just routine stuff. If there are any other issues we should discuss, I'll bring them up later. Are you ready?"I nod yes, and he begins asking me about my childhood, which is pretty boring, but I answer anyway, hoping that I will learn something new. He asks about my parents, siblings,grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. I keep answering, but I really can't remember much about anything before I was ten years old.I've been working hard to try to recall memories from when I was younger, but I haven't had success yet.
After an hour or two of talking, he pulls out a prescription pad,and writes out a couple of prescriptions, and tells me to return the following week. I thank him profusely, and I leave his office, feeling a little better.
The next day,I go back to his office, and I am surprised to see that his office is completely different.It is decorated with a modern, minimalist style. The walls are white, with a large window overlooking the city skyline.I am greeted by a young woman, who is wearing a black pantsuit, and a bright red blouse.

=== Iteration 4     ==============================
My name is Leah Cooper."
He smiles, "And why did you contact me?"
"Well... because..." I begin, trying to think of what would best explain this situation."Because I have been having trouble sleeping lately, and I've had dreams that seem more real than reality. They're disturbing, and they keep waking me up, especially late at night.And I thought maybe if there were somebody else who knew what was going on inside my head, then we might be able to figure something out together."Dr. Szozas nods slowly, and asks, "Can you describe those dreams?""Yes," I say, and I tell him about them. About the strange things I'm seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling, tasting, and all the different sensations that I'm experiencing.And I feel better after telling him about the dreams.It feels good to talk about it with another person, even if it's just a doctor, and I'm relieved when he responds with a sympathetic nod."So do you know what triggered the dreams? What brought about the changes?"
"No, I don't really understand any of this myself yet.It started with my husband leaving me for a younger woman, but I don't want to dwell on that.I guess I should start at the beginning, though, huh?
"You can start anytime, Leah. We'll go back to the beginning whenever you need to.But, please, continue with the story about the dreams. How long has the insomnia been occurring?"
"Since about six months ago.I was fine until I met the guy I live with now. It was only a few weeks later that I began to experience the nightmares.And I was happy with my life before I moved into the house.I was a successful businesswoman, and I owned my own company. I was also a very active member in the community.I was involved with my church, I volunteered at the hospital, I mentored kids at the local school, and I was a huge fan of the arts.

=== Iteration 5     ==============================
My name is Katherine Larkin." I pause, then continue, "And... uh... I don't know why I'm here?"I feel silly saying this, but it just came out. It feels good to say it aloud, though, because I can tell that the doctor likes hearing himself talk.He nods, smiling again, "That's understandable, we all have our own reasons for coming to see us, right? Tell me more about what brings you here today, Katherine."So I start talking about myself, telling him how I've been feeling lately, especially since the beginning of the summer. How I've felt lonely and isolated, almost desperate.And how I think that maybe I should get back together with my husband. That's when things started getting weird.Dr. Szozas listens intently to everything I'm saying, nodding along, asking questions occasionally, which I answer honestly.At one point, I ask, "Have you ever heard of a condition called 'syndrome X,' or something similar?' And he answers, "Yes, I believe I have.Have you seen any other doctors about this?"
I shake my head, no. He continues to listen patiently while I describe the symptoms, and the way I've been feeling.I do not mention the dreams yet.
Then I stop speaking, and look at him expectantly, waiting to hear his thoughts. But he does not speak.Instead, he studies me, his eyes moving slowly up and down my body, taking my measure.His eyes linger on the small mole I wear near the corner of my mouth, before returning to meet mine. His gaze is direct, unblinking.When I look away, I feel a little embarrassed, but I also feel like I am being evaluated, and I am not sure if I am doing a good job.
Finally, Dr.Szozas speaks up, his voice low, "Katherine, I want to assure you that I am going to be completely honest with you, and I hope that you will be with me.I am not a specialist in the field of psychiatry, but I am a very skilled and experienced counselor, and I am always willing to help people who are having problems.

=== Iteration 6     ==============================
My name is Amalia Bredeau." I pause, thinking that this may seem silly, but then again, maybe not. What would I say?My name is Amalia Bredeau... because I'm insane. Or perhaps delusional. And now I feel stupid for even coming in today. But I did email him.
He nods,and looks away, lost in thought, "And what brings you here?"
I start to speak, but I don't know where to begin.I can tell he wants more details than just "I need help". I decide to go straight to the point, "A few months ago, I started seeing things.It all began after I had gone through a divorce, and I was dealing with depression, anxiety, stress, and a lot of other issues.It got really bad, and I was taking medication to try to cope, but nothing seemed to work. I was having panic attacks, and couldn't sleep, and felt very alone.My family doctor prescribed something called Lexapro to try to alleviate the symptoms, but I didn't think it worked. It wasn't working, and I stopped taking them.Then one day, I woke up to find myself sitting in my living room. I had no idea how I got there, but I knew I was naked.My clothes were strewn about the floor, and my car keys, wallet, and cell phone were lying next to my bed.The house was dark, and I realized I had no recollection of leaving. I tried to call 911, but the only number I could remember was my ex-husband's cell. I dialed,and a woman answered, but she wouldn't give me any information, and hung up. I panicked.I knew I needed medical attention, but I didn't have any money, or ID, and I didn't know how I got home. I went outside and saw a man standing by his truck,and I ran to him. He drove me to the emergency room, but I still couldn't remember anything.I told the nurse I'd been raped, and they took me to the hospital. They gave me a rape kit, and I underwent a battery of tests, but the results came back negative.

=== Iteration 7     ==============================
My name is Emily Grace Carlson."
He nods, and then asks, "Emily...?"
"Yes, please call me Emmie.It feels right," I say, feeling silly doing this, but I feel better already just saying her name aloud.
Dr. Szozas smiles again, and leans back in his chair, "So, Emmie, tell me how things have been going for you lately..."
There is something comforting about talking to Dr. Szozas, telling him all about myself.It's like we've known each other forever. And I realize now that I do know him, that I've seen him before, although I don't remember where or when.It makes sense though, because I did meet him online. But I can't recall ever seeing his face before today.The way his eyes study me tells me that he knows more than I want to admit.And he doesn't press me.
Instead, he starts asking questions: How long have I had this problem? What's causing it? Do I think it's psychological?Is there any history of mental illness in the family?
As I answer, he writes notes in a small notebook. He wants to get a complete picture of me before beginning treatment.When I finish, he looks up, "Now let me ask you a few questions, if that is alright with you.It helps us establish a baseline to measure progress, if you will. Just relax and answer honestly. I promise not to judge you, or to be offended by anything you say. Alright?"I nod, "Ok, sure.""Have you experienced a loss recently? A death, divorce, break up with a boyfriend, job loss, financial hardship, etc.?"I shake my head, "No."
"Are you taking medication currently? Any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental conditions that might cause adverse reactions to them?"
"No.""Do you experience any symptoms associated with a sleep disorder, such as insomnia, nightmares, or a tendency to oversleep, and if so, how often does that happen?""No, I'm fine. I wake up at 6am every morning, and I'm usually up until 8pm. I go to bed at 10:30pm most nights."
"

=== Iteration 8     ==============================
My name is Leigh Anne Johnson." My heart races, and my palms get sweaty. This guy really knows what he's doing, doesn't he?If this doctor can help me, then maybe...maybe I'll find peace again. Maybe I'll find happiness again.
He asks more questions, which I answer truthfully.He writes notes, jots things down, and looks back up at me after each question. It's almost like we're having a conversation, except there isn't any physical contact between us.I have a feeling that he likes what he sees, because he smiles broadly whenever I speak.
After all the preliminary stuff is done, and before we begin the actual counseling session, he pauses,puts his hands together, and speaks, "Leigh Anne, do you believe that God created the world?"
I swallow hard, and say, "Yes sir, I do.""Do you think that the world was created by an omnipotent being?"
"Um, yes sir, I guess I do.""And how did you come to that conclusion, Leigh Anne?""Well, I've been reading the Bible lately, and..." I stammer.
"Go ahead," he encourages me."Tell me about it."
So I tell him about the story I found online about the Garden of Eden, and about Adam and Eve. And about Noah, and the flood.I tell him about the miracles that Jesus performed, and about the miracles that the disciples performed.I explain that I believe that the Bible is the word of God, and that He wants me to be happy.
Dr. Szozas listens intently to everything I say.When I'm finished, I feel a little better.I don't know if I'm crazy, but I'm not sure that I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out if I'm the only one who thinks that way.
Dr.Szozas continues to write, and I wonder what he's writing about. He puts his pen down, and turns to me.
"You are a very intelligent young woman, Leigh Anne.You are also a deeply spiritual person.

=== Iteration 9     ==============================
My name is...Karen." I pause, searching for her last name, which is important because I don't want anyone to know anything personal about me. I think back to the night before,and all those strange things happening to me, and then I realize that this doctor knows nothing about any of them. And yet, something tells me that he will understand."So Karen, tell me what brings you to my office?" he asks.It feels good to talk to somebody about it, so I start talking, and I describe everything that happened to me since Sunday morning, right up until I got off work yesterday evening.I mention my sister's call, and how she had mentioned that she was going to get married soon, and I also explain the events leading up to my discovery of my new body.When I finish, Dr.Szazas looks thoughtful, "You say you've been experiencing odd sensations? You feel different, somehow, perhaps even slightly uncomfortable?Have you noticed changes in the way you look or sound?"
"Yes," I answer."And I can't seem to control my voice very well, either. It sounds higher than usual when I speak. Also, my hair feels weird; it doesn't behave the same.I'm not sure if I have a problem, but I do know that I haven't felt like myself. Ever.I'm not sure if I'm depressed, but I'm not sure if I'm not."
Dr.Szazas leans forward, "Did you ever consider that maybe you are changing,that the person you used to be is gone, and a new one is taking its place?"He pauses, and I'm surprised that he is asking me questions about my feelings.I hadn't thought about that possibility, but now that he mentions it, I am curious to find out if that is the case."No, I didn't really think about that. I guess I'm just trying to figure out why I am feeling the way I am.I don't know if I'm getting sick, but I am not happy. I was hoping that you might be able to help me. I would be forever grateful for your advice.I'm willing to pay whatever fee is necessary, and I'll be here tomorrow at 9am, unless you need me sooner.
