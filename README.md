"I'm not sure," he said, "but I think it's a good idea.We'll have to figure out how we're going to get the shark back into its tank."
"You mean that thing is still alive?"she asked.
He nodded and then looked at her with his blue eyes. He had such an innocent face. She felt as if they were talking about something really important but also completely ridiculous. "Yes, it's alive," he answered. "It was dead when we pulled it from the water."
She could see him smiling inside.It made her want to smile too. But she didn't know why.
"Do you think it will eat us?"she asked.
"No," he replied immediately."The sharks are very smart. They don't eat people unless there's no other choice. That one probably wouldn't even try because of all the noise we've been making.""Then what do we need to worry about?"
"Getting it in the boat without being eaten by another shark.And getting away afterward."
They both turned toward the sound of voices coming closer. It sounded like three or four men.They stopped on the dock, looking down at them. Two of them wore dark suits; the third man wore jeans and a T-shirt. The first two men carried guns.The last one seemed unarmed.
"What happened here?"the armed man demanded.
"A shark attacked me," Errol told him.
"Where did this happen?What time?"
Errol pointed to the ocean behind him. "About five minutes ago."
"That's impossible!"the second man exclaimed."There haven't been any reports of a shark attack anywhere around here today! What kind of joke is this?"
"This isn't funny," the third man added."Are you telling me someone actually saw a great white shark right off our beach?"
"Well... yes," Errol admitted sheepishly.
"Who was it?"the second man asked."Me," Errol blurted before realizing who he meant. "I mean, my friend. Me and my sister. We went for a swim."
"Did anyone else go swimming?"the man in the suit asked."Anyone besides your little sister?"
"Just my mother and father,"he said quickly."My mom's sick and dad has to work late tonight.

Prompt:
```
[ Describe Harry and Ron having an encounter with sharks ]
```

Response:
```
"Look out!" yelled Harry. He was still trying to get a grip on the glass, which had been shattered by the blow from Hagrid's hand."Hagrid — he threw something at us! A shark — it's coming!"
He turned back just in time to see the great white hurtling toward him through the water.His eyes widened; his legs gave way...and then suddenly there were hands holding him up and someone shouting: "It's all right, sir, you're safe now!"Harry looked around wildly for Ron, but couldn't see him anywhere. The sea was full of people who seemed to be running away as fast as they could.But what about Ron? Hadn't he seen that thing come after them? Where was he? And where was Hagrid?Wasn't he here somewhere?
Then Harry saw something else moving across the surface of the waves. It looked like a large gray whale, swimming slowly over their heads.But this wasn't one of those whales that lived far off the coast of Scotland or Norway; this was a killer whale, the kind that came up close to shore sometimes.And this particular killer whale was following another animal.The other creature looked very much smaller than itself. Its head was no bigger than a man's fist, its body little more than a meter long.Its skin was dark blue-black, and glistened wetly in the sunlight.As it swam along behind the huge gray whale, it kept looking anxiously back into the distance. But whatever it was afraid of, it didn't seem to have noticed Harry and Ron.
